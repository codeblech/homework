1. Is f : [0, 2 ] R, given by f(x) = cos x, one-one?

2. If f is an invertible function defined as f (x) = (3x-4)/5 , write f–1(x).

3. Show that the function f : R R defined by f(x) = , x ∈ R is neither 
one-one nor onto.

4. The domain of the function f : R → R defined by f (x) = 4-x2 is ______

5. Given a function ‘f ’ as f (x) = 5x + 4, x ∈ R. If g : R → R is inverse of function ‘f ’ then (a) g(x) = 4x + 5 (b) g(x) = 5/(4x-5) (c) g(x) = (x-4)/5 (d) g(x) = 5x – 4

6. Prove that sin-1(4/5)+sin-1(5/13)+sin-1(16/65)=pi/2

7.Prove the following: cos(sin-1(3/5)+cot-1(3/2))=6/(5 13)

8. Simplify: tan-1((acosx-bsinx)/(bcosx+asinx)), if a/b tanx > -1

9.Solve the following equation: tan–1((x+1)/(x-1)) + tan–1(x-1/x) =tan–1(–7).

10. Prove that cot-1((1=sinx + 1-sinx)/(1-sinx - 1-sinx)) = x/2, x (0, pi/4)

11. A trust caring for handicapped children gets 30,000 every month from its donors. The trust spends half of the funds received for medical and educational care of the children and for that it charges 2% of the spent amount from them and deposits the balance amount in a private bank to get the money multiplied so that in future the trust goes on functioning regularly. What per cent of interest should the trust get from the bank to get a total of 1,800 every month? Use matrix method, to find the rate of interest. Do you think people should donate to such trusts?

12. Three schools X, Y and Z organised a fete(mela) for collecting funds for flood victims in which they sold 
hand-held fans, mats and toys made from recycled material, the sale price of each being 25, 100 and 50 
respectively. The following table shows the number of articles of each type sold: 

Using matrices, find the funds collected by each school by selling the above articles and the total funds collected. Also, write any one value generated by the above situation.

13.If A = , find A2- 5A + 4I and hence find a matrix X such that A2- 5A + 4I + X = O

16. If A = and I is the identity matrix of order 2, show that
I + A = (I – A)
